# Team Work Contract

## Expectations

Each group member will aim to have the majority of their portion of the work for that week completed by Thursday evening. This ensures that the team has sufficient time to contact professors and TAâ€™s for assistance if needed.

Github issues will be used as the primary source of communication for important updates/questions.

## Meetings

There will be 2 meetings: lab meetings and Thursday meetings at 9pm. If any member is unable to make it for the meeting, written notice must be given 24 hours before the meeting to discuss alternative options and he/she shall follow up with required responsibilities from the meeting from other members.

Members agree to commit at least 2 hours for meetings per week for discussion on project progress. The group will use lab time (Tuesdays) of each week to discuss task distribution and a meeting towards the end of the week (Thursday evenings) to discuss progress on individual components. 

## Communication

The Github project board will be used to track task progress. All communication outside of the meetings will be through Slack, Zoom, Github or the team google doc. Github will be the primary communication tool for ideas, suggestions, submitting work and reviewing work. Slack will be the primary communication tool for informal communication and scheduling meetings.

## Roles

There are two roles team members will be responsible for each week. The roles are as follows:


1. Scribe
    * Read beforehand the instructions for milestone and prepare a template for meeting on Tues
    * Update google docs with delegated tasks for the week, and update tasks as Github issue 
    * Responsible for sharing with all notes and in-class activities to teammates
2. Proof-readers and Submitter
    * Responsible for doing a final check of the submission before the deadline to make sure all requirements are satisfied.
    * Ask TA if any questions arise.
    * One of them submits the milestone project for the week on behalf of the team.
3. Everyone
    * For every milestone, create 1 issue for each of your own task and drop into project board 

Positions will be rotated each week to ensure that each team member does each position once:

## Pull requests

Pull requests will be done in pairs, so that each team member is clear on who will be accepting his/her PRs, with flexibility of getting someone else to review in case partner is not available: Proof-readers for each milestone will be partners, etc.

## Breach of Contract 

Failure to follow the team contract will result in a three-step warning system, communicated by the Co-leads for the week in which the breach occurs:

1. The first step is a written Slack notice that outlines the violation of the team contract and a reminder of the team contract conditions.
2. The second step is a meeting to discuss the behavior and write an agreement to follow the team contract that is required by the member.
3. The third step is to reach out to the lab instructor or TAs of the issues with the teammate
