# Reflection - Milestone 2
Authors: Christopher Alexander, Jennifer Hoang, Wenxin Xiang, and Michelle Wang

### What has been implemented?
Our group has added 4 interactive plots to our dashboard that describe popular artists and songs on Spotify.
The 3 plots in the "Artists/Genre" tab allow users to explore top artists, artist popularity trends over various album releases,
and the overall popularity distribution of their songs. We have implemented two widgets on this page, 
which allow users to select the genre for the top artists plot from a dropdown menu.
Users can also select specific artists of interest from a dropdown menu to explore their trend and distribution plots in detail.

In the second "Song Characteristics" tab, users can compare musical features between popular and non-popular songs.
The musical feature displayed on the X-axis, as well as the genre of music, can be selected from the dropdown menu.

Overall, our dashboard is able to provide a quick glimpse at the music trends across artists and genres on Spotify in 2020.
This addresses the need of our target users, content managers at Spotify, to get quick and visual insights on music tracks
to support their data driven decision-making process.

### Future Improvements 
To improve the usability of our dashboard, our next steps are to include more interactivity and linkage between plots.
A feature that we would like to implement is to allow users to select an artist from the "Top Artists" chart and link that
selection to the "Artist Trend" and "Artist Popularity Record" plots.

Additionally, there are improvements that could be made to the overall layout and user interface design. 
The sizing of plots and the font size of the axes could be increased to improve the aesthetics and readability. 
The layout of the sidebar and plots could also be improved to work with different window sizes.

Lastly, we have created our dashboard for target users that work at Spotify under the assumption that they are familiar 
with the metrics used. However, it would be useful for a lay audience to provide additional information in "Cards"
to explain the metrics in our dataset, such as "Track Popularity" or "Danceability".

### Limitations
Current limitations of our dashboard are that the data is static and it does not integrate new songs and data from Spotify.
Since music trends are rapidly evolving, our dashboard will only reflect the trends at the time of data collection,
which was in 2020. This limitation of our data source needs to be taken into consideration when drawing conclusions from our dashboard.
