### Description of the data

Our dashboard will be visualizing a dataset describing Spotify's music data. This dataset was derived from TidyTuesday, an open-source dataset website which can be found [here](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/blob/master/data/2020/2020-01-21/readme.md). The dataset contains over 30,000 rows of data and provides useful information about music artists `track_artist`, popularity of tracks `track_popularity` which is a numeric value on a range from 0 (least popular) to 100 (most popular), genres of which the music belong `playlist_genre` such as pop or rock, `track_album_release_date` from 1950s to 2020 and interesting song/audio characteristics such as `loudness` and `key`. As our aim is to understand music popoularity trends in artists and genres, our dashboard will focus primarily on data columns `track_popularity` and `track_artist` as well as `playlist_genre`. These variables are useful in providing insights on which artists and genres are rising in trend and allows Spotify executives to make better-informed decisions.
