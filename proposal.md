### Motivation and purpose

- Our role: Spotify data science team
- Target audience: Spotify content team

The goal of the Spotify Explorer dashboard is to highlight current music trends and identify the most popular artists on Spotify. By summarizing the popularity and song characteristics of Spotifyâ€™s most popular artists in various genres, our dashboard can assist the Spotify Content Team with decisions related to building partnerships with artists and creating new exclusive content, as well as curating more engaging playlists that can attract new users and continue to appeal to existing users. Our dashboard will showcase the most popular artists on Spotify, their evolving popularity over time, the overall distribution of their song popularity, as well as the song characteristics associated with the type of music that they produce.


### Description of the data

Our dashboard will be visualizing a dataset describing Spotify's music data. This dataset was derived from TidyTuesday, an open-source dataset website which can be found [here](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/blob/master/data/2020/2020-01-21/readme.md). The dataset contains over 30,000 rows of data and provides useful information about music artists `track_artist`, popularity of tracks `track_popularity` which is a numeric value on a range from 0 (least popular) to 100 (most popular), genres of which the music belong `playlist_genre` such as pop or rock, `track_album_release_date` from 1950s to 2020 and interesting song/audio characteristics such as `loudness` and `key`. As our aim is to understand music popularity trends in artists and genres, our dashboard will focus primarily on data columns `track_popularity` and `track_artist` as well as `playlist_genre`. These variables are useful in providing insights on which artists and genres are rising in trend and allows Spotify executives to make better-informed decisions.
